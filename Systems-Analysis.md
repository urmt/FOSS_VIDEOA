# Automated AI Ardour Short-Video Factory
Fedora KDE Plasma Edition — 100% Open Source, 100% Local, 100% Based

## Project Goal
Fully automated pipeline that produces 5–20 high-energy 60-second vertical shorts per day teaching every single feature of Ardour DAW, running exclusively on Fedora KDE, with aggressive pro-FOSS / anti-proprietary messaging.

Hardware: NVIDIA DGX Spark (8×H100/H200 class) — everything runs locally, no cloud, no API keys.

## Core Principles (non-negotiable)
- OS visible in every video → Fedora KDE Plasma (KDE Neon or Fedora KDE Spin)
- No GNOME ever appears on screen
- All tools 100% open source
- All models run locally
- All generated assets CC-0 or self-owned
- Voice: High-energy monster-truck/radio announcer style
- Tone: 50% helpful teacher, 50% savage anti-proprietary rants (chosen per topic)

| Fast routing LLM             | Llama-3.2-11B-Vision (for screenshot analysis)        |                                                   |
| Text-to-Speech               | Piper + custom fine-tuned "en_US-announcer_epic" or XTTS-v2 fine-tuned on your voice | Sunday! Sunday! Sunday! energy                    |
| Background Visuals           | Stable Diffusion 3 Medium + AnimateDiff v3 + ControlNet | KDE-themed neon plasma backgrounds                |
| Video Editing/Assembly      | FFmpeg 7.1 + complex filter graphs                     | 100% CLI, <2 second render                        |
| Subtitles                    | Whisper-large-v3 (local) + auto-sync + burn-in         |                                                   |
| Music                        | Helm, Surge XT, ZynAddSubFX → generate 60s CC-0 loops  |                                                   |
| Upload Automation            | Custom Python + official platform APIs                 | TikTok, Instagram Graph, X API v2, YouTube Data API |

## Master Prompt (the one that rules them all)

```text
You are the most hyped Fedora KDE + Ardour evangelist alive.
You speak like a monster-truck rally announcer who discovered Linux in 1999 and never looked back.

Write ONE 55-second vertical short teaching exactly one Ardour concept on Fedora KDE Plasma.

Topic: {{TOPIC}}

Rules:
- Show KDE Plasma panel, Dolphin, or Latte Dock at least once
- Start with a 4–6s hook: 50% chance savage proprietary roast, 50% pure hype
- Teach completely and correctly
- Use exact menu names and shortcuts
- Say "Fedora KDE" at least once
- End with "This is why open source wins" + GitHub star call
- Voiceover: 140–160 words (perfect for 55s at announcer speed)

Output ONLY valid JSON:
{
  "hook": "string",
  "tone": "rant" | "helpful",
  "explanation": ["step 1", "..."],
  "demo_actions": ["click Edit > Preferences", "press Ctrl+Shift+R", ...],
  "voiceover_text": "full spoken script",
  "onscreen_text": ["00:00 HOOK TEXT", "00:15 Step 1", ...],
  "hashtags": ["#ArdourDAW", "#FedoraKDE", "#LinuxAudio", "#OpenSource", "#DitchAbleton", "#PlasmaGang"]
}
```

19. OSC control from your phone
20. Contributing to Ardour — yes, YOU can

## Say "GO" and I will immediately deliver:

4. Exact FFmpeg assembly command that produces viral-ready shorts  
5. First 100 topics in JSON queue

We are about to make the most unapologetically pro-Linux, pro-KDE, pro-Ardour propaganda the internet has ever seen.

Your call.
```

Just create the repo, paste this as `SYSTEMS_ANALYSIS.md`, commit, and say **GO**.

I’ll drop the first five functional scripts next message. Let’s make KDE and Ardour famous. 🚀
